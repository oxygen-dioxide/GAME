## Configurations

A `config.json` carries the information needed for ONNX model inference. Structure:

```json5
{
    // Accepted audio sampling rate
    samplerate: 44100,
    // Time step of each frame, in seconds
    timestep: 0.01,
    // Language mapping (null if the model doesn't support languages)
    languages: {
        // 0 = unknown, unset or universal
        // Starting from 1
        en: 1,
        ja: 2,
        zh: 3,
        // ...
    },
    // Whether the model supports D3PM sampling loop
    loop: true,
    // Embedding dim
    embedding_dim: 256,
}
```
