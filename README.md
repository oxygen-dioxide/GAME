# GAME: Generative Adaptive MIDI Extractor

## Overview

GAME is the upgraded successor of [SOME](https://github.com/openvpi/SOME), designed for transcribing singing voice into music scores.

### Highlights

1. Generative boundary extraction: **trade off quality and speed** through D3PM (Structured Denoising Diffusion Models in Discrete State-Spaces).
2. Adaptive pipeline: notes and pitches can **align and adapt to known boundaries**.
3. Robust model: **works on dirty or separated voice** mixed with noise, reverb or even accompaniments.
4. Multilingual support: choose the right language or a similar one to improve the segmentation results.
5. Thresholds of boundaries and note presence are adjustable.
6. Produces floating point pitch values, same as what SOME does.

### Use cases

1. Transcribe unlabeled raw singing voice waveforms into music scores, in MIDI format.
2. Align notes to labeled word boundaries, in dataset processing scenarios.
3. Estimate note pitches from note boundaries adjusted by user in interactive tuning tools.

## Installation

GAME is tested under Python 3.12, PyTorch 2.8.0, CUDA 12.9, Lightning 2.6.1. But it should have good compatibility.

Step 1: You are recommended to start with a clean, separated UV or Conda environment with suitable Python version.

Step 2: Install the latest version of PyTorch from its [official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

Step 3: Run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 4: If you want to use pretrained models, download them from releases or discussions.

## Inference

### Transcribe raw audio files

The inference script can process single or multiple audio files.

```bash
python infer.py extract [path-or-directory] -m [model-path]
```

By default, MIDI files are saved besides each audio file in the same directory. Text formats (.txt and .csv) are also supported.

For example, transcribing all WAV files in a directory:

```bash
python infer.py extract /path/to/audio/dir/ -m /path/to/model.ckpt --glob *.wav --output-formats mid,txt,csv
```

For detailed descriptions of more functionalities and options, please run the following command:

```bash
python infer.py extract --help
```

### Process singing voice datasets

The inference script is compatible with [DiffSinger dataset format](https://github.com/openvpi/MakeDiffSinger). Each dataset contains a `wavs` folder including all audio files, and a CSV file with the following fields: `name` for item name, `ph_dur` for phoneme durations and `ph_num` for word span. The script can process single or multiple datasets.

```bash
python infer.py align [path-or-glob] -m [model-path]
```

For example, processing single dataset:

```bash
python infer.py align transcriptions.csv -m /path/to/model.ckpt --save-path transcriptions-midi.csv
```

Processing all datasets matched by glob pattern:

```bash
python infer.py align *.transcriptions.csv -m /path/to/model.ckpt --save-name transcriptions-midi.csv
```

For detailed descriptions of more functionalities and options, please run the following command:

```bash
python infer.py align --help
```

## Training

### Data preparation

1. Singing voice dataset with labeled music scores. Each subset includes an `index.csv`. File structure:

   ```text
   path/to/datasets/
   ├── dataset1/
   │   ├── index.csv
   │   ├── waveforms/
   │   │   ├── item1-1.wav
   │   │   ├── item1-2.wav
   │   │   ├── ...
   ├── dataset2/
   │   ├── index.csv
   │   ├── waveforms/
   │   │   ├── item2-1.wav
   │   │   ├── item2-2.wav
   │   │   ├── ...
   ├── ...
   ```

   Each `index.csv` contains the following fields:

   - `name`: audio file name (without suffix).
   - `language` (optional): code of the singing language, i.e. `zh`.
   - `notes`: note pitch sequence split by spaces, i.e. `rest E3-3 G3+17 D3-9`. Use `librosa` to get note names like this.
   - `durations`: note durations (in seconds) split by spaces, i.e. `1.570 0.878 0.722 0.70`.

2. Natural noise datasets (optional). Collect any types of noise or accompaniments and put them into a directory. Be careful not to include singing voice or clear speech voice.

3. Reverb datasets (optional). Put a series of Room Impulse Response (RIR) kernels in a directory, usually in WAV format. [MB-RIRs](https://zenodo.org/records/15773093) is recommended.

### Configuration

This repository uses an inheritable configuration system based on YAML format. Each configuration file can derive from others through `bases` key. Also, in preprocessing and training scripts, configurations can be overridden with dotlist-style CLI options like `--override key.path=value`. 

Most training hyperparameters and framework options are stored in [configs/base.yaml](configs/base.yaml), while model hyperparameters and data-related options are stored in [configs/midi.yaml](configs/midi.yaml). You can also organize your own inheritance structure.

Configure your dataset paths in the configuration:

```yaml
binarizer:
  data_dir: "data/notes"  # <-- singing voice dataset with labeled music scores

training:
  augmentation:
    natural_noise:
      enabled: true  # <-- false if you don't use natual noise
      noise_path_glob: "data/noise/**/*.wav"  # <-- natural noise datasets
    rir_reverb:
      enabled: true  # <-- false if you don't use reverb
      kernel_path_glob: "data/reverb/**/*.wav"  # <-- reverb datasets
```

The default configuration trains a model with ~50M parameters and consumes ~20GB GPU memory. Before proceeding, it is recommended to read the other part of the configuration files and edit according to your needs and hardware.

### Preprocessing

Run the following command to preprocess the raw dataset:

```bash
python binarize.py --config [config-path]
```

Please note that only singing voice dataset and its labels are processed here. The trainer uses online augmentation, so you need to carry everything inside your singing voice, noise and reverb datasets if you need to train models on another machine.

### Training

Run the following command to start a new training or resume from one:

```bash
python train.py --config [config-path] --exp-name [experiment-name]
```

By default, checkpoints and lightning logs are stored in `experiments/[experiment-name]/`. For other training startup options, run the following command:

```bash
python train.py --help
```

You can start a TensorBoard process to see metrics and validation plots:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir [experiment-dir]
```

After validation, you can reduce the size of checkpoint by dropping optimizer states for inference only. Run the following command:

```bash
python reduce.py [input-ckpt-path] [output-pt-path]
```

### Evaluation

Model evaluation uses the same dataset structure, format and configuration file as training. Be sure to use the same feature arguments as the model to evaluate. It is also recommended to read the evaluation configuration:

```yaml
training:
  validation:
	# ...
```

Run the following command to preprocess the test dataset in evaluation mode:

```bash
python binarize.py --config [config-path] --eval
```

Run the following command to evaluate the model on your dataset:

```bash
python evaluate.py -d [dataset-dir] -m [model-path] -c [config-path] -o [save-dir]
```

You can find a `summary.json` in the output directory containing all metric values. If `--plot` option is given, comparison plots will be saved in `plots` folder. For other evaluation startup options, run the following command:

```bash
python evaluate.py --help
```

## Deployment

Models can be exported to ONNX format for further deployment.

### Export ONNX models

Run the following command to export a model:

```bash
python deploy.py -m [model-path] -o [save-dir]
```

By default, ONNX models are exported using opset version 20 (maximum supported version of DirectML EP). If you are using EPs like CUDA or TensorRT, it is recommended to use opset version above 23 to utilize the native `Attention` operator for better performance, by setting `--opset-version` option.

### Inference with ONNX models

We don't provide implementation of ONNX model inference pipeline in this repository. However, you can read the [documentation](ONNX.md) about the workflow and structures, which may help you understand and implement it.
