    This loss encourages the predicted velocities to approach a series of ground truth boundaries.
    1. Apply Distance Transform to compute the distance between each position to its nearest boundary;

    3. Accumulate the velocity through time dimension to get the predicted distance;

        cutoff_radius: int, beyond this radius from the boundary, no momentum is applied.
        decay_power: float, power of the decay function for momentum beyond the constant radius.
        decay_alpha: float, scaling factor for the decay function.
    Inputs:
        velocities: Tensor of shape [B, T], predicted velocities.
         negative means approaching from left side, positive means approaching from right side.
